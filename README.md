Absolutely! Here's a **serious-sounding**, professional-style README that **pretends** to be a legitimate GitHub project—while delivering hilarious, absurd, and bizarre content under the hood.

# 🥷 Sticker Maker -  Ninja Sword Generator

> Procedurally generates ninja swords from everyday objects using arcane logic, speculative kitchen science, and unstable particle-based folklore.

![banana\_katana\_banner](https://fakeimg.pl/800x200/?text=Ninja+Sword+Generator\&font=lobster)

## 📦 Overview

**Ninja Sword Generator** is a modular, extensible framework for synthesizing hyper-lethal ninja swords from household items. It leverages hybrid computational alchemy, non-Euclidean geometry, and *really intense staring* to produce combat-grade blades from otherwise harmless objects.

Whether you're crafting a katana from a banana or a sabre from a scented candle, this tool provides a clean API and a runtime engine for unstable material conversion.

---

## 🔧 Features

* 🍌 **Banana-tempering engine**: Harden fruit through scream-based molecular compression.
* 🧽 **Adaptive object synthesis**: Transforms ordinary sponges, socks, or salad tongs into elite shinobi weaponry.
* 🌀 **Reality-bending forge**: Bypasses conventional physics to achieve edge sharpness rivaling the void.
* 🧠 **Sentient sword personalities**: Every blade includes randomized AI behavior ranging from existential dread to tax fraud.

## 🚀 Installation

We recommend using **SwordSmithCLI**, the official command-line tool.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ninja-sword-generator.git
cd ninja-sword-generator
pip install -r forbidden_requirements.txt
```

> ⚠️ WARNING: Installing may void your appliance warranties and/or attract ancient spirits. Proceed responsibly.

## 🛠️ Usage to create stickers:

```python
from swordforge import NinjaSwordGenerator

# Create an instance
generator = NinjaSwordGenerator()

# Generate a custom sword from a ripe banana
katana = generator.forge(
    base_item='banana',
    enchantments=['chaos', 'mild guilt'],
    sharpness_level='quantum'
)

print(katana.stats())
katana.swing()
```

### Sample Output:

```bash
Forging initiated...
Banana structure stabilized.
Entropy infusion complete.
Blade: Katananana 🍌
Sharpness: 🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌 (Banana++ tier)
Soul Alignment: Chaotic Moist
```

## 🧪 Supported Base Materials

| Object      | Success Rate | Notes                            |
| ----------- | ------------ | -------------------------------- |
| Banana      | 92%          | Best when slightly overripe      |
| Spatula     | 87%          | May retain grilled cheese memory |
| IKEA Manual | 42%          | Risk of summoning furniture      |
| Dryer Lint  | 67%          | Stealth-enhanced weaponry        |
| Lost Sock   | ???          | Unknown outcomes. Often cries.   |

## 🧙‍♂️ Advanced Configuration

Set custom ritual parameters in `ritual_config.yaml`:

```yaml
chant_intensity: "high"
moon_phase: "gibbous"
rage_factor: 4.2
soul_binding:
  enabled: true
  source: "angry playlist from 2007"
```

> Pro Tip: Gibbous moons yield sharper blades, but increased chance of accidental prophecy.

## 📚 Documentation

Comprehensive documentation is available in the `/docs` directory, including:

* `sword_types.md`: Classification of blades (e.g. Cryo-Baguette, Socknife, Spoonblade)
* `rituals.md`: Approved forging chants and interpretive dances
* `troubleshooting.md`: What to do if your sword becomes self-aware or starts a podcast

## 🐛 Known Issues

* Banana swords may ferment in warm environments
* Socks with too much emotional trauma may refuse to cooperate
* IKEA-based blades may disassemble mid-fight
* Some forged blades attempt to unionize
